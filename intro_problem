Introduction / Business problem

The summertime weather in CO is wonderful.  Sunny warm days and crisp cool nights. 
The mountains and foothills all over the Front Range have their rock faces covered with climbers eagerly searching for the next foothold. 
But the winters can be long and cold. 
A solution to the  bitter winds and frost preventing an intrepid climber from perching on their favorite peak is to put the rock ledge inside a big warm building.
Indeed, several indoor rock-climbing gyms can currently be found scattered along the Front Range.  But none of them are your rock-climbing gym.  
We want to show you exactly where your dream gym should be opened.  And what neighborhood site will provide the highest return on your investment. 
Nothing is a sure thing, and all ventures carry risk.  We are living in a time when these risks can be calculated and mitigated 
by powerful technologies and machine learning algorithms.  
We are going to provide you with an array of possible locations that have the maximum potential of financial success and longevity.
