Data

In order to facilitate this process, we will be using FourSquareâ€™s vast collection of data. 
The actions and comments of thousands of users are collected and stored for access by our algorithms. 
Countless actual reactions to myriad venues, events, and experiences can provide a backdrop of information for us to base our calculations on. 
Every currently operating venue in the city will be provided for an exact count of gyms, health clubs, yoga studios, and especially other climbing gyms in the vicinities.
The likes and preferences of the clients that patronize these venues are also collected and will allow us to provide actionable insights into not only the locations,
but also the clientele in those locations and their personal preferences. 
This information will allow you to open your climbing gym in a location that suites your style, and also allow you to operate in a way that will cater to your local clients.
